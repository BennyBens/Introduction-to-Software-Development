1) Write a function to calculate the number of occurances of a list of words in a string.

        pseudo :
        
        for every word in the list:
            count = number of times the word is in the list
            if count > 0:
                print "This word : WORD was in the string COUNT times"
        

2) Write a function which takes a string and returns the same string without any newlines or spaces.

   You may use built in strip, rstrip, lstrip, or replace methods.


3) Write a function which takes a string and a list, and checks if the string contains every word in that list.

   If every word is in the list, the function must print 'Yay!' otherwise, raise a LookupError exception saying 'Not all words exist in the string!'

        You may use either a for loop with len() and range() or enumerate()
        
        pseudo :
        
        for every word in the string:
            for every word in the list:
                if word == word:
                ...
    

4) Write a function which takes a string of words, separated by / (forward slash) and prints them out one by one, 
before using the join() method to joint the words back into the original text and printing it at the end of its operation.
        
        Example output :
        
        string = 'some/words/go/in/here'
        
        Output : 
        
        Word : some
        Word : words
        Word : go
        Word : in
        Word : here
        The original string is : some/words/go/in/here

5) Write a function which takes two lists and checks if they match in size. Your function should return a list.

   The list should contain two elements, one a string which reads 'Yay!' if the lists match in size or 'Boo!' if they do not.
   The second element of the list should be a boolean which is set to True if the lists match in size and False if they do not.
